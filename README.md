# Linux World DevOps Training  (Under construction) 

This is the repository where the Project has been uploaded.

### 1. Setting up the Developer/Host  System

This is the system in which the developer works. We are considering it to be **Windows**. Here, Git is installed and authenticated. To make this project more realistic, we are going to work on 2 GitHub branches:
- master
- dev1

First, we create a new repository in GitHub. We copy the clone url of the repository and clone the it in the Desktop using `git clone <repo url>`.

We move inside the folder just created and create an `index.html` file.
Inside the file, lets type	<br>
`This is from master branch`
<br>
Then we add the file in the Staging Area using `git add . `<br>
Then we commit the changes  using the command: `git commit . -m "first commit from master"`<br>
Finally we push to GitHub using: `git push` <br>

We can also cross-check the contents from the GitHub website to confirm.

Now, we want to work with the `dev1` branch. We want to pull the contents from the `master` branch first.

To create and change the branch, we type: `git checkout -b dev1`
Now, all the codes from `master` branch are present in the `dev1` branch. We want to add an extra line in this branch:<br>
`cat >> This line is from Dev1 branch`

To stage, commit and push, we use the following commands:
```
git add . 
git commit . -m "Second commit from DEV1"
git push -u origin dev1
```

Now, we have setup 2 branches in Github, having some differential codes.


### 2. Setting up the Server System

This is the system where the Web Server will be running. We are going to use Docker to run 2 `httpd` servers, one for deploying the `master` branch and the other for the `dev1` branch. We are going to use RHEL 8 as the Operating System to host the Docker containers.<br>

As we are going to automate the process, we are going to configure Jenkins for creating the CI/CD pipeline.<br>

**Jenkins** would do 2 important tasks for each of the branches:
- Dowloading any code changes from GitHub to the server system.
- Starting the Webserver from Docker containers, to view the final website.

**Jenkins** would do another important task from the **Quality Assurance Team**. If the `dev1` branch is working fine, then Jenkins would merge it with the `master` branch, on being triggered to do so.

We create 2 directories on our Desktop directory from the terminal.
- lwtest
- lwtestdev

The codes downloaded from **GitHub** by **Jenkins** would be placed in these folders according to their branches.

Now, lets configure Jenkins to do all those tasks.

### 3. Configuring Jenkins

Lets start the Jenkins process from RHEL 8 by the command: `systemctl start jenkins`<br>
Now, on visiting the port **8080**, we can see the Jenkins Control Panel running.

But, we are going to configure it from Host / Developer system
